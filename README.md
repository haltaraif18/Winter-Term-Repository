# Winter-Term-Repository
So to change the ReadMe in this the master branch, all I did was open the winter term repository that I have in the bar at the top and did Repository -> open in sublime and I started typing here. Then I saved it. After that I went to the github app -> changes and my changes were there so I put in something for summary and did commit to master. 

Is this a new branch? 
It is not so
Actually it was a new branch and these edits were only in GitDesktop Branch.

So what I did was go to the top bar and did new branch. Then to commit changes I did exactly what was in the first paragraph. Then, I did a pull request and merged on the github site.
