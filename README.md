# Winter-Term-Repository
So to change the ReadMe in this the master branch, all I did was open the winter term repository that I have in the bar at the top and did Repository -> open in sublime and I started typing here. Then I saved it. After that I went to the github app -> changes and my changes were there so I put in something for summary and did commit to master.
